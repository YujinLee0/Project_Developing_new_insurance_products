# 🩺 Development of new insurance products

## 🧩 Business Case

  - Due to the anxiety of modern people, income insurance premiums of life insurance companies have decreased and cancellation refunds have increased, raising concerns over falling sales and stagnant profitability. To overcome this situation, we intend to overcome the management crisis and continue to gain a sales advantage by identifying the information and cancellation characteristics of customers and developing new insurance products that reflect customer needs. 

  - To maintain existing insurance customers, we seek ways to secure new customers by identifying the characteristics of customers and developing new loan products to respond to securing funds, the main cause of leaving customers, and identifying customers suitable for the product. 
  
## ☁️ Task performance flow
  - Identify the characteristics of our policyholders to strengthen the retention of existing customers
